This document clarifies the metric "discrepancy" that I'll use to grade your placers.

As described in Kahng's paper, discrepancy is used to measure the evenness of cell distribution. 
Discrepancy within area A is formally defined as: the maximum ratio of actual total cell area 
to expected cell area over all windows with area A. In the paper, they compute the discrepancy 
within 1% of total placement area.

In our placement project where the chip area is represented as 100x100 grids, 
I fix the window to be 10x10 (1%, a square) grids to obtain the discrepancy - 
the maximum ratio of actual cell area in the 10x10 window to 100 (= 10x10). 
The 10x10 window used is EVERY POSSIBLE 10x10 window across the whole chip. 
Thus, for our project with 100x100 grids, there are 91x91 such windows.

If all gates can be placed VERY EVENLY in the chip area, the discrepancy is 0.75 
since the ideal utilization is 75%. But having discrepancy smaller than 1 is not 
easy for small benchmarks; or you would have a very large HPWL.
In contrast, if you place all gates VERY CLOSELY, the discrepancy can be as high 
as 75 (= 100x100x75%/100). But this is absolutely not what you're supposed to do 
even though you could get a very small HPWL.

As for grading, I would like to see a placement whose utilization is as close as 
75%. Based on this, your goal is to minimize HPWL AND discrepancy. Therefore, do 
not place a bunch of gates in a small area just for small HPWL. It is definitely 
not a good placement.
