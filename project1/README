Project 1 Milestone

The code can be compiled and executed by running "make".

The code is currently based around the brain-dead algorithm described in the
project 1 overview by Brian Taylor. It works well on the small sanity tests
but it has some issues with several of the larger small tests. The 
output of the test is currently printed on the command line but will
eventually be placed in a file as described in the output format file.
